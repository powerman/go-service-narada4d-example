# You shouldn't modify anything in this file BEFORE LAST "VERSION" LINE!
# If you will do this you'll likely BREAK DOWNGRADE for some version.
# Exceptions from this rule are:
# - git rebase
# - add/remove comments, empty lines or do other visual/formatting changes
# - add new DEFINEs
# - modification of downgrade/after_downgrade operations needed to FIX
#   BROKEN DOWNGRADE
